# CommonUI
A fully configurable UI having most commonly used features.

Built using Angular and has features like PWA and state management inbuilt.
We have plans to provide tree shaking feature similar to the one given by webpack (https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/). Elements not defined in your configuration JSON's will be removed from the final build.
